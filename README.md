Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning
This project explores customer segmentation using machine learning techniques on transactional and behavioral data. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing patterns and demographics to help businesses tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

# Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a key part of customer analytics. In this notebook, I applied unsupervised learning methods like K-Means Clustering and PCA to segment customers into meaningful groups. The analysis helps businesses:

Identify high-value customer clusters.

Personalize marketing efforts.

Understand behavior patterns for strategic planning.

# Tools & Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (K-Means, PCA, StandardScaler, Elbow Method)
* Jupyter Notebook

# Steps Performed
* Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and standardized column names.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized key features and identified customer trends.

2. Feature Scaling
Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

3. Clustering with K-Means
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Segmented customers into distinct groups.

4. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
Reduced feature dimensions for better visualization of clusters.

5. Cluster Profiling
Interpreted the characteristics of each customer segment.

# Key Insights
* Discovered unique customer groups based on purchasing behavior and frequency.

* Identified clusters of customers that could be targets for loyalty campaigns or cross-selling opportunities.

* Demonstrated how unsupervised learning can support data-driven marketing decisions.
